# ChatSwat
A GroupMe chat hijack patrol bot

Created in October 2015

Chat hijackers often add themselves to a GroupMe using a group member's phone and then leave immediately to avoid removal. These hijackers then periodically rejoin a group to post troll or spam messages in the chat before vanishing once again. The only way to regain control of a hijacked chat is to make a new chat, which ends up being vulnerable to the same attack.

### ChatSwat 
* uses GroupMe's API to continuously watch over the chat members and immediately remove any anomalies
* can be activated after a hijack has occured to remove rejoining hijackers and regain control of the chat
* can be used as a preventative measure to stop hijacking from occurring in the first place
